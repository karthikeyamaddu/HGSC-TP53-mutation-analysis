# HGSC-TP53-Mutation-Analysis

## üìå Overview
This project focuses on the **computational analysis of TP53 gene mutations** in **Ovarian High-Grade Serous Carcinoma (HGSC)**.  
The goal is to identify **disease-associated mutations** using **machine learning (ML)** and **deep learning (DL)** models, supporting insights for **precision oncology**.

---

## üî¨ Research Motivation
- **TP53** is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers.  
- In **HGSC**, TP53 mutations are nearly universal and play a critical role in tumor progression.  
- Applying AI/ML can help **classify mutations, predict pathogenicity, and guide biomarker discovery**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning mutation datasets  
   - PCA for dimensionality reduction  
   - MinMax scaling and normalization  

2. **Machine Learning Models**  
   - Na√Øve Bayes  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning  
   - AutoML (TPOT) for automated pipeline optimization  

3. **Deep Learning Models**  
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
   - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for mutation-gene network representation  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Stratified cross-validation  
   - Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC metrics  
   - Model interpretability for biological relevance
